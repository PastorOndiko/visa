
A business visa is a type of visa issued to foreign nationals who intend to visit another country for business-related purposes, such as attending conferences, meetings, or negotiating business deals. It allows the visa holder to engage in commercial activities while staying in the host country, but typically prohibits them from performing any work that would be considered a job.
Longer stays
Facilitation of international trade: Business visas help to facilitate international trade and investment, as they enable entrepreneurs, investors, and businesspeople to travel to other countries to meet with potential partners, suppliers, and customers.

Increased networking opportunities: Business visas also provide opportunities for individuals to attend business conferences, trade shows, and other events where they can network with other professionals in their industry and exchange ideas.

Access to foreign markets: Business visas can open up new markets for businesses, providing access to foreign customers and suppliers, which can help companies to grow and expand their operations.

Enhanced reputation: Having a business visa demonstrates that an individual or company is serious about conducting business abroad and can help to enhance their reputation as a reliable and trustworthy business partner.

Longer stays: Business visas may allow for longer stays than tourist visas, which can be particularly advantageous for individuals who need to spend more time on business-related activities.

Overall, a business visa can provide significant advantages for individuals and companies looking to expand their business operations and explore new opportunities in foreign markets.
